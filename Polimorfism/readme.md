# Polymorphism in C#

This project demonstrates the concept of **polymorphism** in C# using object-oriented programming principles. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, enabling more flexible and reusable code.

## Features

- **Base and Derived Classes:** The code defines a base class and multiple derived classes, each implementing or overriding methods to showcase polymorphic behavior.
- **Method Overriding:** Derived classes override base class methods to provide specific implementations.
- **Dynamic Method Invocation:** The project demonstrates how methods are called dynamically at runtime based on the actual object type.
- **Practical Examples:** Includes simple, clear examples to help understand how polymorphism works in C#.

## How It Works

1. **Define a Base Class:** The base class contains virtual methods.
2. **Create Derived Classes:** Each derived class overrides the base class methods.
3. **Use Polymorphism:** Objects of derived classes are referenced using the base class type, and the overridden methods are invoked at runtime.
