# Implementation of Delegates, Events, Tuples, and Lambda Expressions in C#

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of advanced C# concepts, including **delegates**, **events**, **tuples**, and **lambda expressions**. Below is a summary of the topics covered and practical examples included in the code.

---

## 1. Delegates in C#

- **Delegates: Use Cases and Practice**  
  Practical examples of using delegates to encapsulate methods and pass behaviors as parameters.

- **Delegates Practice Part 2**  
  Additional exercises to reinforce the use of delegates in different scenarios.

- **Delegates as Parameters**  
  Implementation of methods that receive delegates as arguments for greater flexibility.

- **Multicast or Combined Delegates**  
  Example of how to combine multiple methods into a single multicast delegate.

- **Anonymous Delegates**  
  Usage of anonymous delegates to define inline methods without prior declaration.

- **Delegates and Interfaces**  
  Integration of delegates with interfaces for more flexible and decoupled designs.

## 2. Events

- **Practical Example Using Events**  
  Implementation of a custom event and its subscription from other objects.

- **Events Practice: Part 2**  
  Additional exercises to deepen event handling skills.

- **Chained Events**  
  Example of how one event can trigger other events in a chain.

- **Built-in .NET Event Handlers**  
  Usage of standard .NET event handlers, such as `EventHandler` and `EventHandler<TEventArgs>`.

## 3. Tuples and Lambda Expressions

- **Tuples in Practice**  
  Practical examples of creating and using tuples in methods and for multiple returns.

- **Lambda Expressions and Statements**  
  Introduction to lambda expressions and their syntax in C#.

- **Practice with Lambda Expressions**  
  Practical exercises using lambda expressions to simplify code.

- **Variables and Iterations in Lambda Expressions**  
  Example of using external variables and loops within lambda expressions.

- **Lambda Expressions Using Tuples**  
  Example of combining tuples and lambda expressions for more complex and concise operations.
